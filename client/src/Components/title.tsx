                Hello! My name is Nicholas Salter and I am a recent graduate from the University of Louisiana
                Monroe, where I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. I am currently looking for 
                full-time employment as a Software engineer. <br/>
                <br/>
                Before graduating I worked as a Computer Analyst at the Louisiana Small Business Development 
                Center on campus. While there, I gained experience in client consulting, problem-solving, software 
                development, e-commerce web development, project management, user-interface design, and marketing.
